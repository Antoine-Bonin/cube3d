# Cub3D

A 3D raycaster game engine written in C. This project explores the fundamentals of raycasting, graphical rendering, and game development using the MinilibX library.

## Description

Cub3D is a simplified 3D game engine that renders a first-person perspective of a maze using raycasting techniques. The project demonstrates:

- **Raycasting algorithm**: Implementation of the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm to cast rays and detect wall intersections
- **Texture mapping**: Wall rendering with directional textures (North, South, East, West)
- **Player controls**: Keyboard and mouse input handling for movement and camera rotation

### The DDA Algorithm

The **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)** is the core algorithm used for raycasting. It works by:

1. **Starting point**: The player's position on the 2D grid
2. **Direction**: The current viewing angle (converted from degrees to radians)
3. **Ray advancement**: Incrementally stepping through the grid in the ray's direction
4. **Intersection detection**: Checking each grid cell for walls
5. **Distance calculation**: Measuring the perpendicular distance to the first wall hit

The algorithm casts one ray per vertical screen column (1920 rays for a 1920px width), creating the illusion of 3D depth through perspective projection.

**Key principle**: The closer the wall, the taller it appears on screen.


### Compilation

```bash
# Compile the mandatory version
make

# Compile the bonus version
make bonus

# Clean object files
make clean

# Full cleanup (removes binaries and libraries)
make fclean

# Recompile everything
make re
```

### Execution

```bash
# Run with a map file
./cub3d maps/map.cub

# Bonus version
./cub3d_bonus maps/map.cub
```

### Controls

**Mandatory:**
- `W` `A` `S` `D` : Move forward/left/backward/right
- `←` `→` : Rotate camera left/right
- `ESC` : Exit the program

**Bonus:**
- `Mouse movement` : Look around
- `Left Shift` : Sprint
- `Wall Colision` : a Wall is a Wall 

### Map File Format (.cub)

The configuration file must specify:
- Texture paths for each wall direction (NO, SO, WE, EA)
- Floor color (F) and ceiling color (C) in RGB format
- A 2D map using characters: `0` (floor), `1` (wall), ` ` (void), `N/S/E/W` (player start position and orientation)

Example:
```
NO ./textures/north.xpm
SO ./textures/south.xpm
WE ./textures/west.xpm
EA ./textures/east.xpm

F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0
